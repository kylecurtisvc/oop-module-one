## What is this project?

This project is the source code for Module 1: Classes & Objects in my OOP class.

The sports app will manage soccer teams and basketball teams by specifying and updating the team,
players, and goals or points.

<br>

## Running the project

Run the project in an IDE as expected, or execute the java class file in a linux terminal (my prefered method):

```sh
cd out/
```

```sh
java SportsApp
```

<br>

output:

```txt
Bayern Munich, 11, has scored 0 goals!
Orlando Magic has 15 players and has a total of 0 points!
Bayern Munich, 11, has scored 1 goals!
